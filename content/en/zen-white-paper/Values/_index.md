  The values driving Zen's development.
type: docs

The values driving Zen's development are:
1. Creating novel, beautiful, well-formatted, semantic HTML and CSS should be dead simple.
1. Amateur web authors should easily create virtually any page structure and style.
1. The interface should have a virtually zero learning curve, and zero should mean zero. Zen must leverage well-known interface metaphors and gestures to the hilt. The "principle of least surprise" should be followed.
1. Zen should not clutter its interface for manipulating and creating semantic and presentation structure with every possible detail. Zen should hide details until they are needed. The user should be able to drill down to these details.
1. The interface should present two modes: one mode to hide purely structural details so that semantic details can be addressed, and another mode to hide semantic details so that the look and feel of a web page can be addressed.
1. Meta organization, like the creation of themes, templates, or partials,{{< fnref 28 >}}<sup>, </sup>{{< fnref 29 >}}<sup>, </sup>{{< fnref 30 >}}<sup>, </sup>{{< fnref 31 >}}<sup>, </sup>{{< fnref 32 >}}<sup>, </sup>{{< fnref 33 >}}<sup>, </sup>{{< fnref 34 >}} should not be precluded by the structure of Zen's low-level tools. The creation of these should be empowered, if not directly implemented, by the low-level tools.
