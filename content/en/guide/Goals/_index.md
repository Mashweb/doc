Motivations and goals are not the same thing. When will Zen be complete? Or when will a version of it really exist? The answer is: when its goals have been met.

In reality, though, Zen has a graded set of possible goals, some imminently achievable and some just remotely believable. Part 2 will break this down. See The Plan for Alpha Zen.
