The values driving Zen's development are:
1. The creation of novel, beautiful, well-formatted, semantic HTML and CSS should be dead simple.
1. Amateur web authors should be able to create virtually any kind of page structure and style.
1. The interface should have a virtually zero learning curve, and zero should really mean zero. Well-known interface metaphors and gestures must be leveraged to the hilt. The "principle of least surprise" should be followed.

1. The interface for manipulating and creating semantic and presentation structure should not be cluttered with details that could be hidden until needed; the user should be able to drill down to these details. The interface should present two modes: one mode to hide purely structural details so that semantic details can be addressed, and another mode to hide semantic details so that the look and feel of a web page can be addressed.
1. Meta organization, like the creation of themes, templates, or partials, should not be precluded by the structure of Zen's low-level tools. The creation of these should be empowered, if not directly implemented, by the low-level tools.
